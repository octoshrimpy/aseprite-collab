/*

In this example, we import the SimplePeer library and the Socket.IO library to handle signaling communication. We connect to the signaling server using the appropriate URL (replace `'http://your-signaling-server-url'` with the actual URL of your signaling server).

The `peer` instance is created with the `initiator: true` option to indicate that it is the initiator of the connection. Event handlers are registered for `signal`, `connect`, and `data` events to manage signaling, establish the peer connection, and handle data transmission.

The `sendData` function can be used to send data to the other user, and the `cleanup` function handles the cleanup of resources and closes the Peer connection.

Ensure that you have installed the necessary dependencies (SimplePeer and Socket.IO) by running `npm install simple-peer socket.io-client` in your project directory.

Remember to integrate this code with your Aseprite plugin and adapt it to fit your specific use case and signaling server setup. Additionally, you may need to handle error cases, implement more advanced functionality, and configure your signaling server accordingly.

Please refer to the documentation of the SimplePeer library for more information on its usage and available options.
